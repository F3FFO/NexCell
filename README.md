# NexCell

**NexCell** is a very simple spreadsheet created for a school exam.
For this reason, some implementation choices may seem strange but have been made to respect the delivery;
in particular I leave some implementation obligations:
- Exploit the mechanisms of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.
- For inheritance it is possible to exploit abstract classes and interfaces; relationships are considered excluded of direct inheritance from Java library classes.
- Use library data structures and generics.
